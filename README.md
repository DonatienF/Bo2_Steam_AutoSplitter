# Bo2_Steam_AutoSplitter
AutoSplitter working on Bo2 Steam version 

I have not tested every map, i have not tested every possibility. <br />
If you encounter any bug, contact me -> @Tripodocus_ on twitter

Found bug :
Sometime the splitter splits a bit too early
The timer doesn't stop when dying in who's who (It does stop when the game ends, but it adds 10+ seconds to the total time)
